# Script to dump GPU vbios from any Unraid GPU 
# by SpaceinvaderOne

##### Read the readme for how to use this script #####

##### FILL IN THE  VARIABLES BELOW #######################################################################

###################
gpuid="05:00.0"
###################
		
#####Name the vbios for example gtx2080ti.rom	

### Naming of the vbios is optional ....  if you do not rename it here then the script will name it based off the details found about the gpu dumped

###################
vbiosname="5600g_vega7.rom"
###################

##### Location to put vbios (change if you dont want to use below location) if location doesnt exist it will be created for you.

###################
vbioslocation="/mnt/user/isos/vbios/"
###################

##### Runs checks on device to see if it is in fact a GPU. Recommended to leave set as "yes"

###################
safety="yes"
